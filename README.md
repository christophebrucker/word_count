# Word Counting Program

This is a Ruby program that counts the occurrences of words in a text file. It reads the contents of a file, processes each line, and counts the occurrences of each word. The program then outputs the words and their respective occurrence counts in ascending order.

## Features

- Reads the contents of a text file
- Counts the occurrences of each word
- Outputs the words and their occurrence counts in ascending order

## Prerequisites

- Ruby installed

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Create or copy the text files for which you want to count the words occurences.
5. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   ruby word_counter.rb
   ```

5. You will be prompted to enter the name of the file you want to scroll through. Enter the file name with the .txt extension and press Enter.
6. The program will process the file, count the occurrences of each word, and output the results.

## Example

Suppose you have a file named `sample.txt` with the following contents:

```
apple orange apple banana apple orange
banana banana apple apple apple
```

When you run the program with `sample.txt` as the input file, the output will be:

```
"orange" has 2 occurrences
"banana" has 3 occurrences
"apple" has 6 occurrences
```
